# Project_Euler

## Introduction

This repository is just some quick coding of (*random*) [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems just for some fun warm-up coding brain teasers. 

## List of completed problems

Note: problems are listed below in the order that I completed them, not related to their problem number.

1. Problem 6 - Sum square difference
	* naive O(n) (linear) solution
	* efficent O(1) (constant) solution

2. Problem 13 - Large sum
	* naive O(n) (linear) solution
