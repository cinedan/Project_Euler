# Project_Euler

## Introduction

This repository is just some quick coding of (*random*) [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems just for some fun warm-up coding brain teasers.

## List of completed problems

Note: problems are listed below in the order that I completed them, not related to their problem number.

1. Problem 1 - Multiples of 3 and 5
    * naive O(n) (linear) solution
    * efficent O(1) (constant) solution

2. Problem 2 - Even Fibonacci numbers
    * naive O(n) (linear) solution

3. Problem 3 - Largest prime factor
    * naive O(n * sqrt(n)) (super linear) solution
    * (much) better O(m * sqrt(m)), where m is the largest prime factor of n

4. Problem 4 - Largest palindrome product
    * naive O(n ^ 2) (quadratic) solution
    * upper triangle O(n ^ 2) (quadratic) solution (cuts search space in half)
    * a better solution should be available by searching backwards along the diagonal of the multiplication table with an A* style search
    * (connection is too flakey to implement right now)

6. Problem 6 - Sum square difference
    * naive O(n) (linear) solution
    * efficent O(1) (constant) solution

13. Problem 13 - Large sum
    * naive O(n) (linear) solution
